* Part 1 (20/20)
* Part 2a.1 (10/10)
* Part 2a.2 (5/5), 2a.3 (5/5)
* Part 2b (15/15)
    * Nice work. For the alternative solution, the aggregation assumes a cardinality range of (20, 380.95). The minimum case is actually 1 group, though--if all cars are owned by 1 person and insured by 1 company. In that case, the average case would come out to about 190.
* Part 3 (15/15)
* Part 4.1 (5/5), 4.2 (10/10), 4.3 (10/10), 4.4 (5/5)
