A set of attributes X is called closed (with respect to a given set of functional dependencies) if X⁺ = X.
Consider a relation with schema R(A,B,C,D) and an unknown set of functional dependencies.
For each closed attribute set below, give a set of functional dependencies that is consistent with it.


1. All subsets of {A,B,C,D} are closed.

only trivial dependencies can exist i.e :
A -> A
B -> B
C -> C
D -> D

2. The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {} and {A,B,C,D}.

A -> B
B -> C
C -> D
D -> A

3. The only closed subsets of {A,B,C,D} are {}, {B,C}, and {A,B,C,D}.

B -> C
C -> B
A -> {B,C,D}
D -> {A,B,C}
