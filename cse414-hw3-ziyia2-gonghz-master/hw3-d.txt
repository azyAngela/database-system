My experience on using this DBMS cloud service is not very good, but it is indeed convenient and have advantages. 
First of all, it is easy to access the data from any local devices, efficient in storing data in a manageable way. 
In addition, I feel our privacy can be ensured since there are many settings on managing security issues, such as 
the two-factor authentification when log in. However, due to the limitation money on the monthly plan, the speed
to process the data is pretty low.
